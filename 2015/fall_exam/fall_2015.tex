\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item A risk-averse Alex possesses $w$ dollars of wealth in money and property.  His house worth $L < w$ dollars can be completely destroyed by a landslide with the probability $p$, $0 < p < 1$. Let’s denote his wealth if landslide occurs by $x_L$ and $x_{NL}$ otherwise. Then his expected utility can be calculated by $E(u) = p \ln x_L + (1-p) \ln x_{NL}$, where $x_L, x_{NL} > 0$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $E(u)$ is a concave function in its domain.
\item Show that the set in  $(x_L, x_{NL})$ plane defined by the inequality $E(u)\geq const$  is convex.
\end{enumerate}

\item In order to reduce risk Alex buys insurance from a perfectly competitive company. By doing that he maximizes his expected utility $E(u)$ with respect to $(x_L, x_{NL})$ subject to constraint imposed by the company $p(w-L-x_L)+(1-p)(w-x_{NL})=0$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Find his optimal bundle  $(x_L^*, x_{NL}^*)$. Use bordered Hessian to check sufficiency. Is Alex better-off with the insurance? Explain.
\item Let $E(u)^*$ be the maximum value of $E(u)$ with insurance. By applying Envelope Theorem find $\partial E(u)^* / \partial p$. Express your answer in terms of $p$, $w$ and $L$ alone.
