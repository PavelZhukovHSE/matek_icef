\subsection{MFE, 2018-10-26 — marking}


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Correct formula of the total differential (2).

Correct partial derivatives (2).

Correct calculation (6).

  \item All three IFT conditions (4).

Correct formula for derivative (2).

Correct calculations (4).

  \item \textbf{Problem 3.}

  Consider the function $f(x,y,z)=x^2+10y^2+2xy+\alpha z$\\
  (a) Find the Hesse matrix. Clearly state the Young theorem if you use it.\\
  (b) For each value of $\alpha$ find the definiteness of Hesse matrix.\\

  \textbf{Solution.}
   $$(a)\; \begin{pmatrix}
  2& 2 &0\\
  2 &20& 0\\
  0& 0& 2\alpha
  \end{pmatrix}$$

  (b) $\Delta_1=2>0$, $\Delta_2=40-4=36>0$, $\Delta_3=72\alpha$.\\
  1. If $\alpha >0$ then all corner principal minors are greater than 0. According to Silvester criterion the Hesse matrix is positive definite.

  2. If $\alpha<0$ then $\Delta_1>0$, $\Delta_2>0$, $\Delta_3<0$. According to Silvester criterion the matrix is indefinite.

  3. If $\alpha=0$ then we need to use generalized Silvester criterion (three corner determinants are not enough!).

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Minors of the 1st order: 2, 20, $2\alpha$. All are non-negative.
  \item Minors of the 2nd order: 36, 0, 0. All are non-negative.
  \item Minors of the 3rd order (the determinant of all matrix) is 0, also non-negative.
  \end{itemize}

  Thus, the matrix is positive semi-definite.
