\begin{enumerate}

1. Given the demand and supply function for the cobweb model as follows, find the intertemporal
equilibrium price, and determine whether the equilibrium is stable:
(a) Qdt = 18 - 3Pt Qst = -3 + 4Pt-1
(b) Qdt = 22 - 3Pt Qst = -2 + Pt-1
(c) Qdt = 19 - 6Pt Qst = -5 + 6Pt-1
2. If a market model with inventory has the following numerical form
Qdt = 21 - 2Pt,
Qst = -3 + 6Pt,
Pt+1 = Pt - 0.3(Qst - Qdt)
find the time path Pt and determine whether it is convergent.
3. Solve the following linear program:
8>>>>>><
>>>>>>:
max(7x1 - 6x2 - x3 - 7x4)
2x1 - 3x2 - 3x3 - x4 6 2,
x1 + 2x2 + x3 - x4 6 1,
x1, x2, x3, x4 > 0.
4. Solve the following linear program:
8>>>>>><
>>>>>>:
max(-x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 - x4),
2x1 + x2 + 2x3 - x4 6 2,
-x1 + x2 + x3 + 3x4 6 2,
xi > 0, i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
5. An economy produces an income Yt at year t. In the absence of governmental expenditures
the following identity is valid: Yt = Ct +It, where Ct is the consumption in year t and It is
the investment in year t. The investment It equals to 75% of the previous year income Yt-1
and there is no autonomous consumption. Let denote the marginal propensity to consume
by k.
Derive a first order difference equation for the consumption Ct. Solve this equation and
find the condition upon k for which consumption will raise from year to year. If k = 0.32,
C0 = 100, sketch and describe the solution Ct for t = 0, 1, 2, . . . . Determine when, if ever,
the consumption in a year first falls bellow 10.
