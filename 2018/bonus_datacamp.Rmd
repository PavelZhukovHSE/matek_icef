Dear ICEF students :) 

You have an opportunity to develop your programming skills and deeper understand optimization role in modern data analysis. 
And receive bonus points for home assignments too!

# What should I do?

1. Register at [datacamp.com](https://datacamp.com) under any email. 

Just fill in your true first and last name.

2. Add your registration email in the list [tiny.cc/kh6b2y](https://tiny.cc/kh6b2y). 

Shortly I will add all email from the list into the group with full free access. 
It is important that you are already registered at datacamp at this moment.

3. Start doing mini-courses!

The first one is [Introduction to python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).
The deadline for this mini-course is postponed to 2019-02-08.
