\item Determine the value of the following integrals

\[ 
\int \frac{\ln (2x)}{x^2} \, dx, \qquad \int \frac{1}{e^{2x}-e^{-2x}} \, dx
\]

\item Use the Lagrange multiplier method to find the maximum value of $f(x,y,z)=(2+\sqrt{x})^2(1+\sqrt{y})^2(2+\sqrt{z})^2$ among positive numbers with $x+4y+z=10$.

\textbf{SECTION B}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item A function $f(x)$ defined on $\mathbb{R}$ is called bounded if there exists a number $M>0$ such that $|f(x)| \leq M$ for all $x$. Consider the equation $y'+ ay = f (x)$, where $a>0$ is a number and $f (x)$  is a bounded continuous function defined on $\mathbb{R}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Using variation of constant method or otherwise find the general solution  
\item  Prove that there exists a bounded particular solution 
\item Let $\tilde{y}(x)$  be a bounded solution existence of which was proven in b). Prove that $\tilde{y}(x)$ is a unique solution with such property. 
\end{enumerate}
Hint: parts b) and c) can be treated separately.


\item Consider a problem of maximizing an output under the budget constraint $F(K,L) \to \max$ subject to $wL+rK=B$, where $w$, $r$ are fixed factor prices, $B$ is firm's budget and $F(K,L)$ is a continuously differentiable homogeneous production function. A set of points $(L(B),K(B))$ forms a so-called firm's expansion path, where $B$ take all positive values and $L(B)$, $K(B)$ are the solutions of the constrained maximization problem.
