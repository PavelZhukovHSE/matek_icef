\textbf{SECTION A}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the set $A=\cup_{i=1}^{\infty} \left\{ 1-\frac{1}{i} \right\} \subset \mathbb{R}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is the set $A$ bounded? Open? Closed? Compact?
\item Roughly sketch the set $A \times A$
\end{enumerate}

\item Consider the system of equations 
\[
\begin{cases}
xyz^2+x^3y+3y^3z^3-2x=3 \\
2x^2yz+z^2+3xy+5yx^3=-5
\end{cases}
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Are the function $x(z)$ and $y(z)$ defined around the point $A=(-1,1,1)$?
\item Find $df/dz$, where $f(z)=x(z)y(z)$
\end{enumerate}
\item Consider the functions $f(x,y)=x^2+2x+y^2+6y+7$ and $g(x,y)=x^2-8x+y^2-10y+9$. Find all the points where the gradients are parallel.
\item Find and classify all the local extrema of the function $g(x,y)=y^3 -12y+x^2e^y$. Which of them are global?
\item It is known that the point $(1,0)$ is the constrained local maximum of the function $f(x,y)=5x-ky-3x^2+2xy-5y^2$ subject to $x+y=1$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the value of $k$ and the maximum value of the function $f$
\item Using Envelope theorem find the new value of maximum if $k$ will increase by $0.1$
\end{enumerate}
\item Use Lagrange multipliers to find the height and radius of a cylinder with the least possible
surface area among those with a volume of $6\pi$ m$^3$. Make sure you check the second order
condition for minimisation.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{SECTION B}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item In perfectly competitive agricultural industry a typical firm uses labor, capital and land. Its short-run costs can be found by the formula $C_{sr}(y,K^*,T^*)=\frac{y^3}{K^*T^*}+K^*+T^*$, where $y$  is the output, $K^*$  and $T^*$  are fixed quantities of capital and land, respectively.
The long run costs $C_{lr}(y)$ can be found by minimizing $C_{sr}$ with respect to $K^*$  and $T^*$.
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Find  $C_{lr}(y)$
\item The profits of the firm in both short-run and long-run can be found by $\pi_{sr}=py-C_{sr}$  and   $\pi_{lr}=py-C_{lr}$, where $p$ is price. When the profits are maximized with respect to the output, the maximum values of these are denoted by $\tilde{\pi}_{sr}(p,K^*,T^*)$ and $\tilde{\pi}_{lr}(p)$, respectively. Let $p=3$. Show that $\tilde{\pi}_{sr}(3,K^*,T^*) \leq 0$ for all values of  $K^*>0$  and  $T^*>0$. 
%\item Without actually calculating the Hessian $D^2_{K^*,T^*}\tilde{\pi}_{sr}$ make a guess about the definiteness of the matrix. Justify your claim.
\item Use Envelope Theorem to evaluate $\frac{\partial \tilde{\pi}_{sr}}{\partial K^*}$ and $\frac{\partial \tilde{\pi}_{sr}}{\partial T^*}$ for $p=3$. Is it possible that these derivatives turn zero simultaneously for $T^* \neq K^*$?
\end{enumerate}

\item Let $f(x)$ be twice continuously differentiable function whose second-order derivative is $f''(x)>0$ for all $x$. Consider a constrained minimization problem $F=\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \to \min$ 
subject to $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1$,  $(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\in \mathbb{R}^n$. Using the first-order conditions find the critical point. By checking bordered Hessian or otherwise show that the found point is minimum.
