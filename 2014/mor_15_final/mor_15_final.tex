\textbf{SECTION A. You need to solve BOTH problems.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Using Lagrange multipliers maximize  the function $f(x_1,x_2,x_3)=-x_1-2x_2+3x_3$ subject to constraints:   $2(x_1+1)^2+x_2^2+3(x_3-1)^2\leq 5$ and $x_1, x_2, x_3 \geq 0$. Find the point(s) of maximum and maximum value of $f$. Justify your answer by reference to Weierstrass theorem if it is relevant.

\item For all real values of parameter $\beta$ that lies within the range $-1<\beta<0$ maximize linear function $2x_1-x_2+8x_3-19$ subject to constraints  $x_1\geq x_2+x_3+\beta$,  $2x_1+x_2+4x_3\leq \beta+1$ and $x_1, x_2, x_3 \geq 0$. You are not asked to find the maximizer.

\end{enumerate}


\textbf{SECTION B. You need to solve TWO problems of your choice. }

\begin{enumerate}[resume]

\item Find the general solution of equation $y''-4y'+8y=\sin 2x + e^{-2x}$.

\item Solve the initial value problem for the system of difference equations

\[
\begin{cases}

\end{cases}
\]

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{SECTION C. You need to solve BOTH problems }

\begin{enumerate}[resume]

\item Andrey and Boris play the following game. Each player throws a fair coin and observes the result of his own toss. Then simultaneously Andrey guesses the result of Boris' toss and Boris guesses the result of Andrey's toss. They receive one dollar each if at least one guess was correct and receive nothing otherwise. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find all pure Nash equilibria of this game
\item Are the Nash equilibria Pareto-optimal?
\item What is the probability of at least one correct guess in the Nash equilibria?
\end{enumerate}

\item Anna and Bella play the simplified version of Battleship game. Anna places a two-decker destroyer ship on the $1\times 4$ grid. Then Bella has one shot. Bella does not know where the Anna's ship is located. If Bella hits the Anna's ship then Bella wins the game, otherwise Anna wins. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find at least one Nash equilibria of this game
\item What is the probability that Anna wins in the Nash equilibria?
\end{enumerate}
